What is this all about?
------------------------

This is a tiny toolset for converting between Transifex and the Mount&Blade *.csv language file format.
It works like an adapter bridging the functionality by using Joomla's INI format as middleman in the translation platform.

[Transifex - Collaborative Web Translation platform] <-> [Joomla INI format] <-> [M&B language file]

It allows to easily translate mods and games of the Mount&Blade series right from the intuitive Transifex web interface.

For maintainers, translations can be pushed (send new original strings to the web interface) and pulled
(grabbing the latest translations from the web, adding them into the game) with ease using an automated process.


Does anybody use it?
---------------------

The script has been successfully used by [Star Wars Conquest] and [The Last Days] modding projects,
translating them in more than six languages in typical crowdsourced fashion, and works both in Windows and Unices.


Works in the original M&B 1.011 too?
-------------------------------------

Yes, it does. The format is all the same.
